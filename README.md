Tic Tac Toe in Haskell - A Functional Programming Approach

This repository contains a Haskell-based implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, developed as part of our Functional Programming course. Emphasizing the principles of lambda calculus, recursion, monads, 
and functors, this project showcases the efficacy of functional programming in problem-solving within the domain of game development.

Project Overview
State Modeling: Utilizes complex data structures such as the Rose tree to represent game states.
Move Generation: Implements Haskell functions to calculate valid moves within the game.
Game Outcome Logic: Employs monads for state management, elegantly handling the game's flow and decision-making process.

Highlights
Advanced Functional Concepts: The codebase applies advanced functional programming techniques to ensure clarity, maintainability, and performance.
Higher-Order Functions: Demonstrates the power of Haskell in creating concise and expressive solutions for game logic and state manipulation.
Practical Application of Theory: Bridges theoretical concepts with real-world application, enhancing the understanding of functional paradigms.
This implementation not only serves as an educational tool for those learning Haskell or functional programming but also as an example of how to apply theoretical computer science concepts to tangible software projects. 
It's designed to encourage creative problem-solving and to advance knowledge in the fields of computing and software engineering.
